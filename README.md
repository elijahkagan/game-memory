2. Difficulty levels.
3. Pair length as a variable. Can be two or more cards.
4. Symbol library based on a random choice from an extensive library.

9. Special method for revealing the matching cards.

## The process:

4. Game redesign with the game  as a single object:
```javascript
var memoryGame = function() {
    console.log(Starting The Memory Game);
};
```
5. Adding the repository to Github.
